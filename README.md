2. [CLI11](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11) - For command line flag parsing
3. [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI) - For creating terminal user interface

### Available Features:

1.  **Play Music**:

	```
    
2.  **Repeat Your Music**:
    
    Specify the number of times you'd like the music to repeat. By default, the track will play once.

## Goal Design
The JamBox TUI will be divided into four components:

2. **Music Names**: Display currently playing song and queue. 
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick glance to common commands.
4. **Music Player**: Basic UI for playback.
